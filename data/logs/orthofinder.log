Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 46086 genes (98.6% of total) to 2662 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 25 or more genes (G50 was 25) and were contained in the largest 889 orthogroups (O50 was 889). There were 990 orthogroups with all species present and 828 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
